# About CSS
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to control the presentation and layout of web pages. It works alongside HTML to define how elements should look, including colors, fonts, spacing, borders, backgrounds, and positioning. CSS allows developers to create visually appealing and responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes and devices. With CSS, styles can be applied inline, internally within HTML, or externally through separate files, promoting reusability and cleaner code. Advanced features like animations, transitions, and media queries make CSS essential for modern web development, ensuring websites are both attractive and user-friendly.
